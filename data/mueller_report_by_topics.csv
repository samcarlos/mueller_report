Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign employees , advisors , and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. 109 The GRU later released stolen Clinton Campaign and DNC documents through online personas , ""DCLeaks"" and ""G uccifer 2.0,"" and later through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign. , the Trump Campaign about WikiLeaks 's activities.

Unit 74455 assisted in the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165, the promotion of those releases, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media accounts operated by the GRU. Officers from Unit 74455 separately hacked computers belonging to state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections. 114 Beginning in mid-March 2016, Unit 26165 had primary responsibility for hacking the DCCC and DNC , as well as email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign: 115 Unit 26165 used                                                    Investigative Technique began before the GRU had obtained any credentials or gained access to these networks , indicating that the later DCCC and DNC intrusions were not crimes of opportunity but rather the result of targeting. 116 GRU officers also sent hundreds of spearphishing emails to the work and personal email accounts of Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers.

"9","Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks","2. Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks a. Initial Access By no later than April 12, 2016, the GRU had gained access to the DCCC computer network using the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully spearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network, identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network. 119 Approximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016, GRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection 120 between the DCCC and DNC networks. 121 Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165 compromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and shared file server. 122 b. Implantation of Ma/ware on DCCC and DNC Networks Unit 26165 implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks two types of customized malware, 123 known as ""X-Agent"" and ""X-Tunnel ""; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool ; and rar.exe , a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent was a multi -function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes , take screenshots, and gather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories , operating systems). 124 X- Tunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable of large -scale data transfers. 125 GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the victim computers. 120 A VPN extends a private network, allowing users to send and receive data across public networks (such as the internet) as if the connecting computer was directly connected to the private network. The VPN in this case had been created to give a small number of DCCC employees access to certain databases housed on the DNC network. Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC's private network , they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers.

Dissemination of the Hacked Materials The GRU ' s operations extended beyond stealing materials , and included releasing documents stolen from the Clinton Campaign and its supporters. The GRU carried out the anonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created-DCLeaks             and Guccifer 2.0-and later through the organization WikiLeaks. 1. DCLeaks The GRU began planning the releases at least as early as April 19, 2016, when Unit 26165 registered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant. 137 Unit 26165 paid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined. 138 The dcleaks.com landing page pointed to different tranches of stolen documents , arranged by victim or subject matter. Other dcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the sender , recipient, and date of the email). To control access and the timing of releas es, pages were sometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public. Starting in June 2016 , the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com , including documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign. These documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular , Google and Microsoft accounts) , rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks. DCLeaks victims included an advisor to the Clinton Campaign , a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign employee, and four other campaign volunte ers. 139 The GRU released through dcleaks.com thousands of documents , including personal identifying and financial information , internal correspondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and information. 140 136 Netyksho Indictment ,i 29.

GRU officers using the DCLeaks persona gave certain reporters early access to archives of leaked files by sending them links and passwords to pages on the dcleaks.com website that had not yet become public. For example , on July 14, 2016, GRU officers operating under the DCLeaks persona sent a link and password for a non-public DCLeaks webpage to a U.S. reporter via the Facebook account. 143 Similarly, on September 14, 2016, GRU officers sent reporters Twitter direct messages from @dcleaks_, with a password to another non-public part of the dcleaks.com website. 144 The DCLeaks.com website remained operational and public until March 2017."

In the hours leading up to the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and managed by Unit 74455 and searched for a number of specific words and phrases in English, including ""some hundred sheets,"" ""illuminati, "" and ""worldwide known.""

Releases were organized around thematic issues, such as specific states (e.g., Florida and Pennsylvania) that were perceived as competitive in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Beginning in late June 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release documents directly to reporters and other interested individuals. Specifically, on June 27, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide ""exclusive access to some leaked emails linked [to] Hillary Clinton's staff."" 148 The GRU later sent the reporter a password and link to a locked portion of the dcleaks.com website that contained an archive of emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016. 149 That the Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters access to a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website tends to indicate that both personas were operated by the same or a closely-related group of people. 1so The GRU continued its release efforts through Guccifer 2.0 into August 2016. For example, on August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress documents related to the candidate's opponent. 1st On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona transferred approximately 2.5 gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from the DCCC to a U.S . blogger covering Florida politics. 1s2 On August 22, 2016 , the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S . reporter documents stolen from the DCCC pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement. 1s3 147 Releases of documents on the Guccifer 2.0 blog occurred on June 15, 2016; June 20, 2016; June 21, 2016; July 6, 2016; July 14, 2016; August 12, 2016; August 15, 2016; August 21, 2016; August 31, 2016; September 15, 2016; September 23, 2016; October 4, 2016; and October 18, 2016. ~~ccifer20@aol.fr                               to                            (subject ""leaked emails""); ■ 149 6/27/16 Email, uccifer20 @aol.fr to                              (sub' ect ""leaked emails"" ; ; see also 6127/16          uccifer20@aol.fr to (subject ""leaked emails"");                                      ( claiming DCLeaks was a ""Wikileaks sub project""). 150 Before sending the reporter the link and password to the closed DCLeaks website, and in an apparent effort to deflect attention from the fact that DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 were operated by the same organization, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent the repm1er an email stating that DCLea ks was a ""W ikileaks sub project"" and that Guccifer 2.0 had asked DCLeaks to release the leaked emails with ""closed access"" to give reporters a preview of them . 151 Netyksho Indictment   ,r43(a). 152 Netyksho Indictment ,r43(b ). 153 Netyksho Indictment ,r43(c). 43 NA U.S. Department of Justice AtierHey Werk Predttet // Moy CeHtttiHMaterial Preteeted UHeer Fed.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) Investigative Technique . On October 7, 2016 , WikiLeaks released the first emails stolen from the Podesta email account. In total, WikiLeaks released 33 tranches of stolen emails between October 7, 2016 and November 7, 2016. The releases included private speeches given by Clinton; 177 internal communications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign ; 178 and correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation. 179 In total , WikiLeaks released over 50,000 documents stolen from Podesta ' s personal email account. The last-in-time email released from Podesta' s account was dated Mar ch 21, 2016, two days after Podesta received a spearphishing email sent by the GRU. d. WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged , WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statement s apparentl y designed to obscure the source of the materials that WikiLeaks wa s releasing. The file-transfer evidence described abov e and other information uncovered during the investigation discredit WikiLeaks's claims about the source of material that it posted. Beginning in the summer of 2016 , Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements about Seth Rich , a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016. The statements about Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails . On August 9, 2016, the @WikiLeaks Twitt er account posted: ""ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder ofDNC staffer Seth Rich. "" 180 Likewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, ""Why are you so interested in Seth Rich's killer?"" and responded , ""We 're very interested in anythin g that might be a threat to alleged Wikileaks sources. "" The interviewer responded to Assange ' s statement by commenting , "" I know you don ' t want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you 're suggesting a man who leaked information to WikiLeaks wa s then murdered."" Assange replied , ""If there ' s someone who's potentially connected to our publication , and that person has been murder ed in suspicious t 79 Netyksho Indictment ,r43. 180 @WikiLeaks 8/9/ 16 Tweet. 48 NA U.S. Department of Justice Attort1eyWork Prndttet ,'/ May Cot1:tait1:    Material Proteeted Ut1:derFed.

But it is a very serious matter ... that type of allegation is very serious, as it's taken very seriously by us."" 181 After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation , Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking. According to media reports , Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an ""inside job,"" and purported to have ""physical proof ' that Russians did not give materials to Assange. 182 C. Additional GRU Cyber Operations While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states. 1. Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims On July 27 2016 , Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton's personal office                       . Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that included the following: ""Russia , if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" 183 The ""30,000 emails"" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State. Within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time Clinton's personal office. After candidate Trump's remarks , Unit 26165 created and sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain                              including an email account belonging to Clinton aide                        The investigation did not find evidence of earlier GRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public. 184 Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate copies of the DNC da                             function designed to allow users to produce backups of databases (referred to                 as ""snapshots ""). The GRU then stole those snapshots by moving 181 See Assange: ""Murdered DNC Staffer Was 'Potential' WikiLeaks Source, "" Fox News (Aug. 25, 2016)(containing video of Assange interview by Megyn Kelly). 182 M.

"12","Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U  S  Elections","2. Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. 186 The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations. 187 The GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a technique known as ""SQL injection,"" by which malicious code was sent to the state or local website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents). 188 In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE's website. The GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters, 189 and extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified. 190 GRU officers Investigative Technique                      scanned state and local websites for eriod in July 2016, GRU officers - for vulnerabilities on websites of more than -·            Netyksho Indictment ,i 34; see also SM-2589105-HACK , serial 29 Investigative Technique 185 186 Netyksho Indictment ,i 69. -             Investigative Technique 188 50 NA U.S. Department of Justice AttorHey Werle Proattet // Moy CoHtoiHMoteriol Proteetee UHeer Fee.

Unit 74455 also sent spearphishing emails to public officials involved in election administration and personnel a~               involved in voting technology. In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of .....         , a voting technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company network. Similarly, in November 2016 , the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U .S. election. 191 The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software (commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer. 192 The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes that this operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained above , did not undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do so. D.

"13","Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials","2. Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials Throughout 2016, the Trump Campaign expressed interest in Hillary Clinton's private email server and whether approximately 30,000 emails from that server had in fact been permanently destroyed, as reported by the media . Several individuals associated with the Campaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and other stolen material in support of the Trump Campaign. Some of these contacts were met with sk~pticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree. The investigation did not find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any s~ch Clinton emails, or that these contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign. a. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg) In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Florida- based Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton . Caputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky. Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting. 260 Oknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate involved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information on Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to possess financial statements demonstrating Clinton's involvement in money laundering with Rasin's companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer, stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research. 261 Oknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin's motivation was financial. According to Oknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other interested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold .262 Rasin is noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton . The Office found no other evidence that Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities. In their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections about the meeting. Oknyansky claimed that Caputo accompanied Stone to the meeting and provided an introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he was never told what information Oknyansky offered. Caputo also stated that he was unaware Oknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.263 26 °Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at l. 261 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1-2. 262 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 2. 263 Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at l. 61 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atlet'Ae;· \¥erk Pr0a1:1et// May CeAtttiA Mttterittl Preteetea UAaer Fea. R. Crim. P. 6(e) The Office did not locate Rasin in the United States, although the Office confirmed Rasin had been issued a Florida driver's license. The Office otherwise was unable to determine the content and origin of the information he purportedly offered to Stone. Finally , the investigation did not identify evidence of a connection between the outreach or the meeting and Russian interference efforts. b. Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails After candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would ""find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the deleted Clinton emails.264 Michael Flynn-who would later serve as National Security Advisor in the Trump Administration - recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly , and Flynn subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails. 265 Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn about her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266 Smith, an investment advisor who was active in Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails. 267 Ledeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn's request , as early as December 2015. 268 On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails, stating, ""Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be happy to talk with you either in person or over the phone. The person can get the emails which 1. Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated. ""269 Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the ""Clinton email server was, in all likelihood , breached long ago,"" and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services could ""re-assemble the server's email content."" 270 The proposal called for a three-phase approach. The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with certain intelligence sources ""that have access through liaison work with various foreign services"" to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted , ""Even if a single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]"" Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and 264 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 5-6; Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. 265 Flynn 5/1/18 302, at l -3. 266 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 7; Flynn 5/4/18 302, at 1-2; Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7-8. 267 Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7. 268 Szobocsan 3/29/17 302, at 1. 269 12/3/ 15 Email, Ledeen to Smith. 270 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith (attachment). 62 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atlertte~• \\'erk Predttet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetet:I Uttt:ler Fed.

According to one of Smith's business associates , Smith believed Ledeen's initiative was not viable at that time. 272 Just weeks after Trump's July 2016 request to find the Clinton emails , however , Smith tried to locate and obtain the emails himself. He created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers with ""ties and affiliations to Russia"" who had access to the emails , and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump Campaign. 273 On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject ""Sec . Clinton's unsecured private email server"" to an undisclosed list ofrecipients , including Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The email stated that Smith was ""u]ust finishing two days of sensitive meetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the Clinton 's home -based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players , and private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests , are circling to release ahead of the election. ""274 On September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC in furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails. 275 One of the purposes ofKLS Research was to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative. 276 KLS Research received over $30,000 during the presidential campaign , although Smith represented that he raised even more money. 277 Smith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for and authenticate the emails .278 In early September 2016, as pait of his recruitment and fundraising effort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was ""in coordination"" with the Trump Campaign, ""to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization."" 279 The document listed multiple individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, including Flynn , Clovis, Bannon, 271 12/3/15 Email, Smith to Szobocsan & Safron. 272 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 1. 27 3 8/31/16 Email, Smith to Smith. 274 8/28/16 Email, Smith to Smith. 275 Incorporation papers ofKLS Research LLC , 7/26/17 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 2. 276 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 3. 277 Financial Institution Record of Peter Smith and KLS Research LLC , 10/31/ 17 - 10/11/16 Email, Smith to 278 Tait 8/22/17 302, at 3; York 7/12/17 302, at 1-2; York 11/22/ 17 302, at 1. 279 York 7/13/17 302 (attachment KLS Research , LLC, ""Clinton Email Reconnaissance Initiati ve,"" Sept. 9, 2016). 63 NA U.S. Department of Justice AM:at't=tey Wark Pra<:ittet// Moy CaHtoiHMaterial Prnteete<:iUl'l:<:ier    Fee.

In September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their respective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, ""wondering if you had some more detailed reports or memos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we last visited ... . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it against the new data we have found and then could share it back to you 'your eyes only.' "" 282 Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the ""dark web"") that purpo1ted to be the deleted Clinton emails. Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails and solicited contributions to fund that effort . Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor to ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that the emails were not authentic. 283 A backup of Smith's computer contained two files that had been downloaded from WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on Smith's computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect when the files were downloaded to Smith ' s computer. (It appears the creation date was when WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c , supra. 284) The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks. Smith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton ' s deleted emails until shortly before the election. For example , on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there was a ""tug -of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,"" and that WikiLeaks ""has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this allows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.""285 An attachment to the 280 The same recruitment document             listed Jerome Corsi under ""Independent Groups/Organizations/Individuals,"" and described him as an ""established author and writer from the right on President Obama and Sec.

See Volume I, Section 111.B.3.c,supra. The Office tested this theory in March 2019 by downloading the two files found on Smith ' s computer from WikiLeaks's site using the same Apple operating system on Smith's computer ; both files were successfully downloaded and retained the October 2, 2016 creation date.

Smith drafted multiple emails stating or intimating that he was in contact with Russian hackers. For example , in one such email, Smith claimed that, in August 2016 , KLS Research had organized meetings with parties who had access to the deleted Clinton emails, including parties with ""ties and affiliations to Russia."" 286 The investigation did not identify evidence that any such meetings occurred. Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on the initiative did not believe that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers and were aware of no such connection. 287 The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers or that Smith, Ledeen, or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaign ultimately obtained the deleted Clinton emails . *** In sum, the investigation established that the GRU hacked into email accounts of persons affiliated with the Clinton Campaign , as well as the computers of the DNC and DCCC. The GRU then exfiltrated data related to the 2016 election from these accounts and computers, and disseminated that data through fictitious online personas (DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0) and later through WikiLeaks. The investigation also established that the Trum Cam ai n dis la ed interest in the WikiLeaks releases, and that explained in Volume I, Section V.B, infra, the evidence was sufficient to support computer- intrusion and other char es a ainst GRU officers for their role in election-related hackin . 286 8/31/16 Email, Smith to Smith. 287 Safron 3/20/18 302, at 3; Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 6. 65 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atlef'l'le;·Wef'k Pf'et.ittet// Mo; Cel'ltttiftMttteriol Preteeted Uftt.ierFed.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN The Office identified multiple contacts- ""links ,"" in the words of the Appointment Order- between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation examined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the Campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available information, the investigation did not establish such coordination . This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals with ties to the Russian government , including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and extending through the post-election, transition period. A. Campaign Period (September 2015 - November 8, 2016) Russian-government -connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in Trump ' s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015. 288 Because Trump's status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a busin ess contact with Russia-linked"
"14","Trump Tower Moscow Project","individuals and entities during the campaign period-the Trump Tower Moscow project , see Volume l, Section IV.A. I, infra-led to or involved coordination of election assistance. Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016, when Trump was moving toward- and eventually becoming -t he Republican nominee for President. As set forth below, the Office also evaluated a series of links during this period: outreach to two of Trump 's then-recently named foreign policy advisors, including a representation that Russia had ""dirt"" on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (Volume I, Sections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and has connections with its government (Volume I, Section IV.A.4); a meeting at Trump Tower between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was ""part of Russia and its government's support for [Trump]"" (Volume I, Section IV.A.5); events at the Republican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post- Convention contacts betwe en Trump Campaign officials and Russia's ambassador to the United States (Volume I, Section IV .A.7) ; and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for a Russian oligarch and a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine (Volume I, Section IV.A.8). 288 For example, on August 18, 2015, on behalf of the editor-in-chief of the internet newspaper Vzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phone or in-person candidate interview. 8/18/15 Email, Asatryan to Hicks.

Trump Tower Moscow Project The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as part of its real estate portfolio.       Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership (through subsidiary corporate structures) of property. In other cases , the Trump Organization has executed licensing deals with real estate developer s and management companies, often local to the country where the project was located. 289 Between at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal in Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project, commonly referred to as a ""Trump Tower Moscow"" or ""Trump Moscow"" project , anticipated a combination of commercial , hotel , and residential properties all within the same building. Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including then- president of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian counterparties. From the fall of 2015 until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the Trump Organization's pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the project's status to candidate Trump and other executives in the Trump Organization. 290 a. Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014) The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group , a Russian real estate conglomerate owned and controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-based real estate project shortly after the conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. 291 Donald J. Trump Jr. served as _the primary negotiator on behalf of the Trump Organization; Emin Agalarov (son of Aras Agalarov) and Irakli ""Ike"" Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations, 292 with the occasional assistance of Robe1t Goldstone. 293 In December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of 289 See, e.g., Interview of Donald J Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committe e, 115th Cong. 151-52 (Sept. 7, 2017) ( discussing licensing deals of specific projects). 290 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D.l , supra, in November 20 18, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress concerning, among other things, the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow project.

As has been widely reported, the Miss Universe pageant-which Trump co-owned _at the time-was held at the Agalarov-owned Crocus City Hall in Moscow in November 2013.

Some time before January 24, 2014, the Crocus Group sent the Trump Organization a propo sal for a 800-unit, 194-me ter building to be · constructed at an Agalarov-owned site in Moscow called ""Crocus City,"" which had also been the site of the Miss Universe pageant. 297 In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov and toured the Crocus City site during a visit to Moscow. 298 From March 2014 through July 2014, the groups discussed ""design standards"" and other architectural elements. 299 For example, in July 2014, members of the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the ""de mographics of these prospective buyers "" in the Crocus City area, the development of neighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portions of the building. 300 In August 2014, the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded tower being built in Crocus City. 301 Beginning in September 2014, the Trump Organization stopped responding in a timely fashion to correspondence and proposals from the Crocus Group. 302 Communications between the two groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the last communication is dated November 24, 2014. 303 The project appears not to have developed past the planning stage, and no construction occurred. 294 295 OSC-KA V_00452 (12/23/13 Email, Trmnp Jr. to Kaveladze & E.

In approximatel y September 2015 , Felix Sater , a New York- based real estate advisor , contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump. 304 Sater had previously worked with the Trump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects. Sater had explored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump Organi zation and therefore knew of the organization's general inter est in completing a deal there .305 Sater had also served as an informal agent of the Trump Organization in Moscow previousl y and had accompanied lvanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid- 2000s. 306 Sater contacted Cohen on behalf of I.C. Expert Investment Company (LC. Expert) , a Russian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov .307 Sater had known Ro zov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014 , had served as an agent on behalf of Rozov during Rozov's purchase of a building in New York City. 308 Sater later contacted Rozov and proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which l.C. Expert would license the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. Sater worked on the deal with Rozov and another .emplo y ee of l.C. Expert .309 Cohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with l.C. Exp ert or its agents . In approximately September 2015 , Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with I.C. Expert from candidat e Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization. Cohen provid ed updat es directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016 , assuring him ° the project was continuing .31 Coh en also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the proje ct311) and Donald J.

P. 6(e) 1 Also during the fall of 2015, Cohen communicated about the Trump Moscow proposal with Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a business executive who previously had been involved in a development deal with the Trump Organization in Batumi, Georgia. 313 Cohen stated that he spoke to Rtskhiladze in part because Rtskhiladze had pursued business ventures in Moscow, including a licensing deal with the Agalarov-owned Crocus Group. 314 On September 22, 2015 , Cohen forwarded a preliminary design study for the Trump Moscow project to Rtskhiladze, adding ""I look forward to your reply about this spectacular project in Moscow ."" Rtskhiladze forwarded Cohen 's email to an associate and wrote, ""[i]f we could organize the meeting in New York at the highest level of the Russian Government and Mr. Trump this project would definitely receive the worldwide attention ."" 315 On September 24, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent Cohen an attachment that he described as a proposed ""[!Jetter to the Mayor of Moscow from Trump org,"" explaining that ""[ w ]e need to send this letter to the Mayor of Moscow (second guy in Russia) he is aware of the potential project and will pledge his support ."" 316 In a second email to Cohen sent the same day, Rtskhiladze provided a translation of the letter , which described the Trump Moscow project as a ""symbol of stronger economic, business and cultural relationships between New York and Moscow and therefore United States and the Russian Federation ."" 317 On September 27, 2015 , Rtskhiladze sent another email to Cohen , proposing that the Trump Organization partner on the Trump Moscow project with ""Global Development Group LLC,"" which he described as being controlled by Michail Posikhin, a Russian architect, and Simon Nizharadze. 318 Cohen told the Office that he ultimately declined the proposal and instead continued to work with LC. Expert, the company represented by Felix Sater. 319 c. Letter of Intent and Contacts to Russian Government (October 2015-January 2016) i. Trump Signs the Letter of Intent on behalf of the Trump Organization Between approximately October 13, 2015 and November 2, 2015 , the Trump Organization (through its subsidiary Trump Acquisition, LLC) and I.C.

This is good really good.328 According to Cohen , he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time. Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the candidat e suggested that his campaign would be a significant ""infomercial "" for Trump-branded prope1ties .329 ii. Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia Given the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required approval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government , including from the Presidential Administration of Russia. 330 Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the Presidential Administration through another Russian business contact. 331 In early negotiations with the Trump Organization , Sater had alluded to the need for government approval and his attempts to set up meetings with Russian officials . On October 12, 2015 , for example , Sater wrote to Cohen that ""all we need is Putin on board and we are golden ,"" and that a ""meeting with Putin and top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [of October]. "" 332                               this meeting was being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian government. 333 Approximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed lvank a Trump on behalf of Erchova's then-husband Dmitr y Klokov , to offer Klokov ' s assistance to the Trump Campaign. 334 Klokov was at that time Director of External Communicati ons for PJSC Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, a large Russian electricity transmission 328 11/3/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12 :40 p.m.) . 329 Coh en 9/12/ 18 302, at 3-4; Cohen 8/7/ 18 302, at 15. 330 Sater 12/15/17 302 , at 2. 331 Sater 12/15/ 17 302 , at 3-4. 332 10/ 12/15 Email , Sat er to Cohen (8:07 a.m.). 333 334 Ivanka Trump received an email from a wom an who identified herself as ""Lan a E.

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen. 335 He told the Office that , after receiving this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov's name and concluded (incorrectly) that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter. 336 Between November 18 and 19, 2015,-Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call and exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a ""trusted person "" who could offer the Campaign ""political synergy"" and ""synergy on a government level,"" Klokov recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary . Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the candidate and an individual Klokov described as ""our person of interest."" 337 In an email to the Office, Erchova later identified the ""person of interest"" as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 338 In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump-- including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin-would                      need to be ""in conjunction with the development and an official visit"" with the Trump Organization receiving a formal invitation to visit. 339 (Klokov had written previously that ""the visit [by candidate Trump to Russia] has to be informal. "") 340 Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over a possible meeting between Trump and ""the person of interest "" from any existing business track. 341 Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have ""phen omenal "" impact ""in a business dimension"" and that the ""pe rson of interest['s]"" ""most important support"" could have significant ramifications for the ""level of projects and their capacity.""

Cohen explained that he did not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with Sater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government. 344 By late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to use those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials. Cohen told Sater that he was ""setting up the meeting myself. "" 345 On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed the office of Dmitry Peskov , the Russian government's press secretary, indicating that he desired contact with Sergei Ivanov , Putin's chief of staff. Cohen erroneously used the email address ""Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru"" instead of ""Pr_peskova@prpress.gov .ru,"" so the email apparently did not go through. 346 On January 14, 2016, Cohen emailed a different address (info@prpress .gov.ru) with the following message: Dear Mr. Peskov, Over the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City. Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has stalled. As this project is too important , I am hereby requesting your assistance. I respectfully request someone, preferably you; contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon. 347 Two days later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak with Sergei Ivanov. 348 Cohen testified to Congress, and initially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a response to this email inquiry and that he decided to terminate any further work on the Trump Moscow project as of January 2016.

Writing from her personal email account , Poliakova stated that she had been trying to reach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided. 350 Shortly after receiving Poliakova's email , Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes. 351 Cohen described to Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and outlined the proposed Trump Moscow project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization had partnered. Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to build the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and took notes , stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia. 352 Cohen could not recall any direct follow -up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up. However, the day after Cohen ' s call with Poliakova , Sater texted Cohen, asking him to ""[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat .. .

Sater 's Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia The late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015 , Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian governm ent officials and possible financing partners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to Russia for meetings. 358 On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.

We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite & have visa issued. 360 In response , Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport. 361 Cohen told the Office that at one point he requested a copy of candidate Trump's passport from Rhona Graff, Trump's executive assistant at the Trump Organization, and that Graff later brought Trump ' s passport to Cohen's 357 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-7. 358 See, e.g., 12/1/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:41 p.m.) (""Please scan and send me a copy of your passport for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.""). 359 Toll records show that Sater was speaking to Evgeny Dvoskin.

Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate that Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum. 367 On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen: Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is Russia's Davos it's June 16-19.

Cohen was concerned that Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as Sater had alleged) , and so he decided not to go to the Forum. 373 On June 14, 2016 , Cohen met Sater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be traveling at that time. 374 ii. Candidate Trump's Opportunities to Travel to Russia The investigation identified evidence that , during the period the Trump Moscow project was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts. First, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling to Russia with Trump twice: once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016. 375 According to Cohen, Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion, Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the candidate's schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski , who suggested that they speak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated , however , that he knew that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate 's preexisting commitments to the Campaign. 376 Second, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma-a contact oflvanka Trump ' s from the fashion industry-first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump from Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. 377 On January 14, 2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Duma stating that Trump was ""honored to be asked to participate in the highly prestigious"" Forum event, but that he would ""have to decline"" the invitation given his ""very grueling and full travel schedule"" as a presidential candidate. 378 Graff 37 °FS000 18 (6/9/16 Text Messages,   Sater & Cohen). 371 6/13/16 Email , Sater to Cohen (2:10 p.m.). 372 FS00018 (6/13/16 Text Message , Sater to Cohen (2:20 p.m.)); 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen. 373 Cohen 9/12/18 302 , at 6-8. 374 FS00019 (6/14/16 Text Messages, Cohen & Sater (12:06 and 2:50 p.m.)). 375 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 2. 376 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 7. 377 12/21/15 Email, Mira to Ivanka Trump (6:57 a.m.) (attachments); TRUMPORG_16_000057 (1/7/16 Email, I.

According to written answers from President Trump, 380 Graff received an email from Deputy Prime Minister Prikhodko on March 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg. 381 Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, Graff prepared for Trump 's signature a two-paragraph letter declining the invitation. 382 The letter stated that Trump's ""schedule has become extremely demanding"" because of the presidential campaign, that he ""already ha[ d] several commitments in the United States"" for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise ""would have gladly given every consideration to attending such an important event. ""383 Graff forwarded the letter to another executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead for Trump to sign. 384 At approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman-a New York-based investment banker- began reaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting with candidate Trump. According to Foresman , he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian presidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the Forum. 385 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the televis ion show The Apprentice). In his email , Foresman referenc ed his long-standing personal and professional expertise in Russia and Ukraine , his work setting up an early ""private channel "" between Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an ""approac h"" he had received from ""senior Kremlin officials"" about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, Corey Lewandowski , or ""another relevant person"" to discuss this and other ""concrete thin gs"" Foresman felt uncomfortabl e discussing over ""unsecure email.

According to Foresman, the ""concrete things"" he referenced in the same email were a combination of the invitation itself , Foresman's personal perspectives on the invitation and Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest Institute). For esman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him to another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that Kobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate withdrew from the race and the other politician's participation did not work out. 392 Finally , Foresman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the reference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recogni zed any of the experts announced as Trump's foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with the candidate to share his professional background and policy views , including that Trump should decline Kobyakov 's invitation to speak at the Forum .393"

One week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to candidate Clinton. Papadopoulos shared information about Russian ""dirt "" with people outside of the Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official. Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did · not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the relevant period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never came to pass. a. Origins of Campaign Work 395 In March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign. As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in a September 30, 2015 email , he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors. 396 In late 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. 397 Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 20 I 6, Papadopoulos had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016. 398 At that time, Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP) , which billed itself as a ""unique institution . . . comprising high-level professional international law practitioners, dedicated to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the practice of international law."" 399 Papadopoulos said that he had finished his role with the Carson 394 Papadopoulos met with our Office for debriefings on several occasions in the summer and fall of 2017, after he was arrested and charged in a sealed criminal complaint with making false statements in a January 2017 FBI interview about, inter alia, the timing, extent, and nature of his interactions and communications with Joseph Mifsud and two Russian nationals: Olga Polonskaya and Ivan Timofeev. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to an information charging him with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § lO0l(a). 395 A Transcript of Donald Trump's Meeting with the Washington Post Editorial Board, Washington Post (Mar. 21, 2016). 396 7/15/15 Linkedln Message, Papadopoulos to Lewandowski (6:57 a.m.); 9/30/15 Email, Glassner to Papadopoulos (7:42:21 a.m.). 397 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2. 398 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2; 2/4/16 Email, Papadopoulos to Idris. 399 London Centre oflnternational Law Practice, at https://www.lcilp.org/ (via web.archive.org). 81 NA U.S. Department of Justice AttorHe;· Work Prodttet // May CotttaiH Material Proteeted UHder Fed.

Mifsud is a Maltese national who worked as a professor at the London Academy of Diplomacy in London, England. 4 13 Although Mifsud worked out of London and was also affiliated with LCILP, the encounter in Rome was the first time that Papadopoulos met him. 414 Mifsud maintained various Russian contacts while living in London, as described further below. Among his contacts was                        ,415 a one-time employee of the IRA , the entity that carried out the Russian social media campaign (see Volume I Section II, supra). In January and February 2016 , Mifsud and -                 discussed                        possibly meeting in Russia. The investigation did not~                                  meeting.

According to Papadopoulos , Mifsud at first seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos when they met in Rome .416 After Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump Campaign, however, Mifsud appeared to take greater interest in Papadopoulos. 417 The two discussed Mifsud ' s European and Russian contacts and had a general discussion about Russia; Mifsud also offered to introduce Papadopoulos to European leaders and others with contacts to the Russian government. 418 Papadopoulos told the Office that Mifsud ' s claim of substantial connections with Russian government officials interested Papadopoulos, who thought that such connections could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump Campaign. 419 411 Papadopoulos  8/10/17 302, at 2-3; Papadop oulos Statement of Offense   ,r5. 412 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2-3; Stephanie Kirchgaessner et al., Joseph Mifsud: more questions than answers about mystery professor linked to Russia, The Guardian (Oct. 31, 2017) (""Link Campus University ... is headed by a former Italian interior minister named Vincenzo Scotti.""). 413 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense    ,r5. 414 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 3. ,,  ,•   Investigative Technique 1Harm to Ongoing Matter 416 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense    ,r5. 4 17 Papadopoulos Statement of Offens e ,r5. 418 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 3; Papadopoulos 8/11/17 302, at 2. 419 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r5. 83 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werle Prnat:tet// May Cef!taifl Material Prnteetea URaer Fee.

Mifsud introduced Polonskaya as a former student of his who had connections to Vladimir Putin. 423 Papadopoulos understood at the time that Polonskaya may have been Putin ' s niece but later learned that this was not true .424 During the meeting, Polonskaya offered to help Papadopoulos establish contacts in Russia and stated that the Russian ambassador in London was a friend of hers .425 Based on this interaction, Papadopoulos expected Mifsud and Polonskaya to introduce him to the Russian ambassador in London, but that did not occur. 426 Following his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos sent an email to members of the Trump Campaign ' s foreign policy advisory team. The subject line of the message was ""Meeting with Russian leadership--including Putin."" 427 The message stated in pertinent part: I just finished a very productive lunch with a good friend of mine, Joseph Mifsud, the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy--who introduced me to both Putin's niece and the Russian Ambassador in London--who also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister. 428 The topic of the lunch was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.

From 2004 to 2007, Page was the deputy branch manager of Merrill Lynch's Moscow office. 517 There, he worked on transactions involving the Russian energy company Gazprom and came to know Gazprom ' s deputy chief financial officer , Sergey Yatsenko. 518 In 2008, Page founded Global Energy Capital LLC (GEC), an in~ advisor firm focused on the ener sector in emerging markets .519 ----- 520 The company otherwise had no sources of income , and Page was forced to draw down his life savings to support himself and pursue his business venture. 521 Pa e asked Yatsenko to work with him at GEC as a senior advisor on a contin In 2008, Page met Alexander Bulatov, a Russian government official who worked at the Russian Consulate in New York. 523 Pa e later learned that Bulatov was a Russian intelli ence 524 officer, In 2013 , Victor Podobnyy, another Russian intelligence officer working covertly in the United States under diplomatic cover, formed a relationship with Page. 525 Podobnyy met Page at an energy symposium in New York City and began exchanging emails with him. 526 Podobnyy and Page also met in person on multiple occasions, during which Page offered his outlook on the future of the energy industry and provided documents to Podobnyy about the energy business. 527 In a recorded conversation on April 8, 2013, Podobnyy told another intelligence officer that Page was interested in business opportunities in Russia. 528 In Podobny y's words, Page ""got hooked on 517 Testimony of Carter Page, Hearing Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intellig ence, 115th Cong. 40 (Nov. 2, 2017) (exhibit). 518 Page 3/30/17 302, at 10. 519 520 521 523 524 525 Complaint ,r,r22, 24, 32, United States v.

Origins of and Early Campaign Work In January 2016, Page began volunteering on an informal, unpaid basis for the Trump Campaign after Ed Cox, a state Republican Party official, introduced Page to Trump Campaign officials. 539 Page told the Office that his goal in working on the Campaign was to help candidate Trump improve relations with Russia. 540 To that end, Page emailed Campaign officials offering his thoughts on U.S.-Russia relations, prepared talking points and briefing memos on Russia, and 529 Buryakov Complaint. 530 Buryakov Complaint. 531 Buryakov Complaint. 532 See Buryakov Com laint; see also Indictment United States v.

Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that candidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow. 557 On June 19, 2016 , Page followed up again to request approval to speak at the NES event and to reiterate that NES ""would love to have Mr. Trump speak at this annual celebration"" in Page's place .558 Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, "" If you want to do this, it would be out side [sic] of your role with the DJT for President campaign.

"17","Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest","4. Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest Members of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the National Interest (CNI), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri Simes. CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government. Simes was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. In April 2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event hosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and Russian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in relation to Sessions's confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various other contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. Jared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the campaign. The investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or from the Russian government through CNI or Simes. a. CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign CNI is a Washington-based non-profit organization that grew out of a center founded by former President Richard Nixon. 593 CNI describes itself ""as a voice for strategic realism in U.S . 594 foreign policy,"" and publishes a bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, the National Interest.          CNI is overseen by a board of directors and an advisory council that is largely honorary and whose members at the relevant time included Sessions, who served as an advisor to candidate Trump on national security and foreign policy issues. 595 Dimitri Simes is president and CEO of CNI and the publisher and CEO of the National Jnterest.596 Simes was born in the former Soviet Union, emigrated to the United States in the early 1970s, and joined CNI' s predecessor after working at the Carnegie Endowment for International 593 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 1-2. 594 About the Center, CNI, available at https://cftni.org/about/. 595 Advisory Counsel, CNl, available at https://web.archive.org/web /20161030025331 / http://cftni.org/about/advisory-council/ ; Simes 3/8/18 302, at 3-4; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 4; Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 16. 596 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 2. 103 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werk Preflttet // Moy CeRtttift Material PrnteeteEI Uttfler Fee.

As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie Corporation in 2015, CNI has ""unparalleled access to Russian officials and politicians among Washington think tanks, "" 599 in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia and for Russian delegations to visit the United States as patt of so-called ""Track 11"" diplomatic ·efforts.600 On March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York. 601 The idea behind the event was to generate interest in CNI's work and recruit new board members for CNI. 602 Along with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner , son-in-law of candidate Trump. 603 Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was having trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result , he decided to seek Simes's assistance during the March 14 event. 604 Simes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephone call,605 three days after Trump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short notice. 606 On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person , one-on-one meeting in Kushner's New York office. 607 During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to handle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent with Trump's voice. 608 Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion. 609 Simes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign regarding the Campaign's foreign policy positions. For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent J.D.

Following those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would provide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI officials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including Sessions's chief of staff, Rick Dearborn. 612 In mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller and forward ed to Simes an outline of the foreign -policy speech that Miller had prepared .613 Simes sent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI Executive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt. 6 14 Simes received subsequent draft outlines from Miller , and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive changes to the speech. 615 It is not clear , however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not, and the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft. 616 After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNl's hosting the speech could be perceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication , the National Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club. 617 Kushner later requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that Simes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns about security and capacity. 618 61 °C00008187    (6/17/16 Email, Simes to Gordon (3:35:45 p.m.)). 611 Simes 3/8/18 302 , at 7. 612  Simes 3/8/18 302, at 8-11; C00008923 (4/6/16 Email, Simes to Burt (2:22:28 p.m.)) ; Burt 2/9/18 302, at 7. 6 13 C00008551 (4/17/16 Email , Kushner to Simes (2:44:25 p.m.)); C00006759 (4/14/16 Email Kushner to Simes & S.

P. 6(e) On April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event rooms at the Mayflower to host both the speech and a VIP reception that was to be held beforehand .6 19 Saunders understood that the reception - at which invitees would have the chance to meet ·candidate Trump--would be a small event. 620 Saunders decided who would attend by looking at the list of CNI' s invitees to the speech itself and then choosing a subset for the reception. 62 1 CNI's invitees to the reception included Sessions and Kislyak. 622 The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to the speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump. 623 When the pre -speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized so that attendees could meet Trump. 624 Sessions first stood next to Trump to introduce him to the members of Congress who were in attendance. 625 After those members had been introduced , Simes stood next to Trump and introduced him to the CNI invitees in attendance , including Kislyak. 626 Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thought it clear that Kislyak and Trump had just met for the first time. 627 Kislyak also met Kushner during the pre- speech reception. The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner recalled Kislyak saying , ""we like what your candidate is saying ... it's refreshing. "" 628 Several public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech reception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time. 629 Sessions stated to investigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation. 630 Nor did anyone else affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception. 631 It appears that , if a conversation occurred at the pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view , similar to the exchange between Kushner and Kislyak. 6 19 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 11-12; C00006651-57 (Mayflower Group Sales Agreement). 620 Saunders 2/15/18 302 , at 12-13. 621 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12. 622 C00002575 (Attendee List); C00008536 (4/25/ 16 Email, Simes to Kushner (4:53:45 p.m.)). 623 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 19-20. 624 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 625 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 626 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 627 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 2 1. 628 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 4. 629 See, e.g., Ken Dilanian, Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions Have an Undisclosed Meeting With Russian? , NBC News (June 1, 2016); Julia Ioffe, Why Did Jeff Sessions Really Meet With Sergey Kislyak , The Atlantic (June 13, 2017) . 630 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22 . 63 1 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 14, 21; Boyd 1/24/ 18 302, at 3-4; Heilbrunn 2/1/18 302, at 6; Statement Regarding President Trump's April 27, 2016 Foreign Policy Speech at the Center for the National Interest, CNI (Mar. 8, 2017). 106 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atteffle~· Werk Pfeattet // Mtty Cefltttifl Mt1terittl Preteetea Umler Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) The Office found no evidence that Kislyak conversed with either Trump or Sessions after the speech, or would have had the opportunity to do so. Simes, for example, did not recall seeing Kislyak at the post -speech luncheon, 632 and the only witness who accounted for Sessions's whereabouts stated that Sessions may have spoken to the press after the event but then departed for Capitol Hill. 633 Saunders recalled, based in part on a food-related request he received from a Campaign staff member, that Trump left the hotel a few minutes after the speech to go to the airport. 634 c. Jeff Sessions's Post-Speech Interactions with CNI In the wake of Sessions' s confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about whether Sessions's campaign-period interactions with CNI apart from the Mayflower speech included any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian -related matters. With respect to Kislyak contacts , on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI 's Distinguished Service Award dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C. 635 Sessions attended a pre-dinner reception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event.636 A seating chart prepared by Saunders indicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have responded to the invitation by indicating he would attend the event. 637 Sessions, however , did not remember seeing, speaking with, or sitting next to Kislyak at the dinner. 638 Although CNI board member Charles Boyd said he may have seen Kislyak at the dinner, 639 Simes, Saunders, and Jacob Heilbrunn--editor of the National Interest-all had no recollection of seeing Kislyak at the May ° 23 event. 64 Kislyak also does not appear in any of the photos from the event that the Office obtained. In the summer of 20 16, CNI organized at least two dinner s in Washington , D.C. for Sessions to meet with experienced foreign policy professionals. 641 The dinners included CNI- affiliated individuals, such as Richard Burt and Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq and the person who had introduced Trump before the April 27, 2016 foreign- 632 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 22; Heilbrunn 2/1/ 18 302, at 7. 633 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 4. 634 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 15. 635 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22 ; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 17. 636 Saunders 2/15/18 302 , at 17; C00004779-80 (5/23/16 Email , Cante lmo to Saunders & Hagberg (9:30: 12 a.m.); C00004362 (5/23/16 Email, Bauman to Cantelmo et al.

Jared Kushner's -Continuing Contacts with Simes Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election , Jared Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes. 648 Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings and phone conversations , which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes had proposed. 649 Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians. 650 According to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with Kushner , advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and told Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle any contacts with Russians with care. 651 Kushner generally provided a similar account of his interactions with Simes. 652 Among the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016 , at Simes' s request, in Kushner's New York office.

During the August 17 meeting , Simes provided Kushner the Clinton-related information that he had romised. 658 Simes told Kushner that , Simes claimed that he had received this information from former CIA and Reagan White House official Fritz Ermarth, who claimed to have learned it from U.S. intelligence sources, not from Russians. 660 Simes perceived that Kushner did not find the information to be of interest or use to the Campaign because it was, in Simes's words, ""old news."" 661 When interviewed by the Office , Kushner stated that he believed that there was little chance of something new being revealed about the Clintons given their long career as public figures, and that he never received from Simes information that could be ""operationalized"" for the Trump Campaign. 662 Despite Kushner's 653 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 29-30; Simes 3/27 /18 302, at 6; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 12; C00007269 (8/10/16 Meeting Invitation, Vargas to Simes et al.); DJTFP00023484 (8/11/16 Emai l, Hagan to Manafmt (5:57:15 p.m.)). 654 C00007981-84 (8/9/16 Email, Simes to Kushner (6:09:21 p.m.)).

"18","June 9  2016 Meeting at Trump Tower","5. June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov . Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the ""Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia "" as ""part of Russia and its government 's support for Mr. Trump."" Trump Jr. immediately responded that ""if it ' s what you say I love it,"" and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls. Trump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to attend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it occurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an upcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton , without linking the meeting to Russia. According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of learning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he was made aware of the meeting--or its Russian connection-before it occurred. The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had previously worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr . requested evidence to support those claims, but Veselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique of the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected . After the election , Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not engage. a. Setting Up the June 9 Meeting i.

According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful. 705 Hicks denied any knowledge of the June 9 meeting before 2017, 706 and Kushner did not recall if the planned June 9 meeting came up at all earlier that week. 707 Michael Cohen recalled being in Donald J.

We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the June 9 meeting . On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give ""a major speech"" ""probably Monday of next week""-which would have been June 13-about ""all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons."" See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting , Trump changed the subject of his planned speech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, could well have caused the change. The President 's written answers to our questions state that the speech's focus was altered ''[i]n light of ' the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses , supra. As for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that ""he expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available , negative inf01mation about the Clintons,"" and that the draft of the speech prepared by Campaign staff""was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.""

In a July 2017 press interview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection to the Russian government and had not referred to any derogatory information concerning the Clinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaign officials. 737 Veselnitskaya's November 2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9 meeting was not to connect with ""the Trump Campaign"" but rather to have ""a private meeting with Donald Trump Jr.-a friend of my good acquaintance's son on the matter of assisting me or my colleagues in informing the Congress members as to the criminal nature of manipulation and interference with the legislative activities of the US Congress."" 738 In other words, Veselnitskaya claimed her focus was on Congress and not the Campaign.

"19","Events at the Republican National Convention","6. Events at the Republican National Convention Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention . The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention, J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and national security, diluted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing ""lethal"" assistance to Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee personnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only ""appropriate"" assistance be provided to Ukraine. The original sponsor of the ""lethal"" assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her (the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to dilute the language.        Gordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he acknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the proposed language was inconsistent with Trump ' s position on Ukraine. a. Ambassador Kislyak's Encounters with Senator Sessions and J.D. Gordon the Week of the RNC In July 2016, Senator Sessions and Gordon spoke at the Global Partners in Diplomacy event , a conference co-sponsored by the State Department and the Heritage Foundation held in Cleveland , Ohio the same week as the Republican National Convention (RNC or ""Convention""). 775 Approximately 80 foreign ambassadors to the United States , including Kislyak, were invited to the conference. 776 On July 20, 2016, Gordon and Sessions delivered their speeches at the conference. 777 In his speech, Gordon stated in pertinent part that the United States should have better relations with 773 Samochornov 7/13/17 302, at 1. 774 775 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9; Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22; Allan Smith, We Now Know Mor e About why Jeff Sessions and a Russian Ambassador Crossed Paths at the Republican Convention, Business Insider (Mar. 2, 2017). 776 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9; Laura DeMarco, Global Cleveland and Sen.

Change to Republican Party Platform In preparation for the 2016 Convention, foreign policy advisors to the Trump Campaign, working with the Republican National Committee, reviewed the 2012 Convention's foreign policy platform to identify divergence between the earlier platform and candidate Trump ' s positions. 788 The Campaign team discussed toning down language from the 2012 platform that identified Russia as the country 's number one threat, given the candidate's belief that there needed to be better U .S. relations with Russia. 789 The RNC Platform Committee sent the 2016 draft platform to the National Security and Defense Platform Subcommittee on July 10, 2016, the evening before its 778 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9. 779 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22; Luff 1/30/18 302, at 3. 780 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9; Luff 1/30/18 302, at 3. 781 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9. 782 Sessions 1/ 17/18 302, at 22; Luff 1/30/18 302, at 3; see also Volume I, Section IV.A.4.b, supra (explaining that Sessions and Kislyak may have met three months before this encounter during a reception held on April 26, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel). 783 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22. 784 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9-10. 785 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 9-10. 786 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10; see also Volume I, Section IV.A.3.d, supra (explaining that Page acknowledged meeting Kislyak at this event). 787 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10. 788 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10. 789 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10. 124 NA U.S. Department of Justice A:ttemey 'Nerk Pretittet // May Cetttaifl Material Prnteeteti UHtier Fed.

Gordon, to take a hands-off approach 793 and only to challenge platform planks if they directly contradicted Trump 's wishes . On July 11, 2016, delegate Diana Denman submitted a proposed platform amendment that included provision of armed support for Ukraine. 794 The amendment described Russia's ""ongoing military aggression"" in Ukraine and announced ""supp01t"" for ""maintaining (and, if warranted , increasing) sanctions against Russia until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored"" and for ""providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine ' s armed forces and greater coordination with NA TO on defense planning."" 795 Gordon reviewed the proposed platform changes, including Denman 's .796 Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of Trump's stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March 31 foreign policy meeting-namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any assistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not want to start World War III over that region. 797 Gordon told the Office that Trump's statements on the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored those positions to the point where Gordon felt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seek its dilution. 798 On July 11, 2016, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Platform Subcommittee , Denman offered her amendment. 799 Gordon and another Campaign staffer, Matt Miller, approached a committee co-chair and asked him to table the amendment to permit further discussion. 800 Gordon's concern with the amendment was the language about providing ""lethal 790 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10; Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1-2. 79 1 Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 10. 792 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 7-8. 793 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Gordon 8/29/ 17 302, at 10. 794 DENMAN 000001-02, DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22; Denman 12/4/ 17 302, at 1; Denman 6/7 /17 302, at 2. 795 DENMAN 000001-02 , DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22 . 796 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10-11. 797 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 11; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11; Gordon 2/14/19 302 , at 1-2, 5-6. 798 Gordon 2/14/19 302, at 5-6. 799 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; see DENMAN 000014. 800 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; Denman 12/4/ 17 302, at 2; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11-12; see Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 2. 125 NA U.S. Department of Justice Attomey \Vork Prodttet // May Cofltaifl: Material Proteeted Uflcler Fecl.

Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he could not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in the proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that all three Campaign advisors supported the alternative formulation (""appropriate assistance ""). 809 Dearborn recalled Gordon warning them about the amendment, but not weighing in because Gordon was more familiar with the Campaign's foreign policy stance. 810 Mashburn stated that Gordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that the Campaign should not intervene .811 When the amendment came up again in the committee 's proceedings , the subcommittee changed the amendment by striking the ""lethal defense weapons"" language and replacing it with 80 1 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 3. 802 M.

"21","Paul Manafort","8. Paul Manafort Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman, from March to August 2016. 838 Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who prev iously ran Manafort 's office in Kiev and who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee ,839 to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign-including                       internal polling data , although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska . Gates periodically sent such polling data to Kilimnik during the campaign. 834 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 6; Landrum 2/27/18 302, at 4-5. 835 Sessions 1/17/l 8 302, at 23. 836 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. 837 Sessions 1/ 17/18 302, at 23. 838 On August 21, 2018, Manafo1t was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax, Foreign Bank Account Registration (FBAR), and bank fraud charges. On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States (money laundering , tax fraud, FBAR, Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy to obstruct justice (witness tampering). Manafort also admitted criminal conduct with which he had been charged in the Eastern District of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung. The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort 's work in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work , as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended. On March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution. On March 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafo1t to a total term of 73 months: 60 months on the Count 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on the Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences. The two sentences resulted in a total term of 90 months. 839 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D. l .b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement. He has provided information and in-court testimony that the Office has deemed to be reliable. See also Transcript at 16, United States v. Paul J Manafort, Jr., l :17-cr-201 (D.D.C.

The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016 , in New York City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a message from former Ukrainian President Viktor Y anukovych, who was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a ""backdoor "" means for Russia to control eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an email to Manafort expressing the view-which Manafort later said he shared-that the plan ' s success would require U.S. support to succeed: ""all that is required to start the process is a very minor ' wink' (or slight push) from [Donald Trump ]."" 840 The email also stated that if Manafort were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his reception in Russia ""at the very top level."" Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email described above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office reviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about the plan in written questions. 841 The investigation did not uncover evidence ofManafort's passing along information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or the Administration. The Office was not , however, able to gain access to all of Manafort ' s electronic communications (in some instances , messages were sent using encryption applications). And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement. 842 The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's ur ose in sharin with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort                                                  did not see a downside to sharing campaign information , and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would Investigative Technique .  .. . ..

The judge presiding in Manafort ' s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort intentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues). Although the report refers at times to Manafort' s statements , it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated to be trustworthy, to identify issues on which Manafort 's untruthful responses may themselves be of evidentiary value, or to provide Manafort's explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to determine whether that explanation was credible. 130 NA U.S. Department of Justice AtterHey Werk Predttet // Mtt:,·CeAtttiHMttterittl Prnteeted UHder Fed.

As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement""-a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort ' s credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort ' s sharing polling data and Russia's interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. a. Paul Manafort's Ties to Russia and Ukraine Manafort' s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company Dl\1P International LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to communicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes Ukrain ian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort's communications with Deripaska and Ukrainian oligarchs. i.    Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work In approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who has a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with Vladimir Putin. 843 A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in 2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits that the work could confer on ""the Putin Government."" 844 Gates described the work Manafort did for Deripaska as ""political risk insurance ,"" and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install friendly political officials in countries where Deripaska had business interests. 845 Manafort's company earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions of dollars by Deripaska as well. 846 In 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners L.P. (""Pericles""), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner Richard Davis. The Pericles fund was estab lished to pursue investments in Eastern Europe. 847 Deripaska was the sole investor. 848 Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led 843 Pinchuk et al., Russian Tycoon Deripask a in Putin Delegation to China, Reuters (June 8, 2018). 844 6/23/05 Memo, Manafort & Davis to Deripaska & Rothchild. 845 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 7. 846 Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 2-5; Manafort Income by Year , 2005 - 2015; Manafort Loans from Wire Transfers, 2005 - 2015. 847 Gates 3/12/18 302, at 5. 848 Manafort 12/16/15 Dep., at 157:8-11. 131 NA U.S. Department of Justice Att6mey W6rk Prndttet // Miey Cmitaitt Material Preteeted Umier Fed.

"22"," Political Consulting Work","ii.   Political Consulting Work Through Deripaska, Manafort was introduced to Rinat Akhmetov , a Ukrainian oligarch who hired Manafort as a political consultant. 852 In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in political work supporting the Party of Regions, 853 a political party in Ukraine that was generally understood to align with Russia. Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power , and its candidate , Viktor Yanukovych , won the presidency in 2010. Manafort became a close and trusted political advisor to Y anukovych during his time as President of Ukraine. Yanukovych served in that role until 2014, when he fled to Russia amidst popular protests. 854 iii.   Konstantin Kilimnik Kilimnik is a Russian national who has lived in both Russia and Ukraine and was a longtime Manafort employee. 855 Kilimnik had direct and close access to Yanukovych and his senior entourage, and he facilitated communications between Manafort and his clients, including Yanukovych and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs. 856 Kilimnik also maintained a relationship with Deripaska's deputy, Viktor Boyarkin, 857 a Russian national who previously served in the defense attache office of the Russian Embassy to the United States .858 849 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 9. 850 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 6. 851 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 9-10. 852 Manafort 7 /30/14 302, at 1; Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 2. 853 Manafort 9/11/18 302, at 5-6. 854 Gates 3/16/18 302 , at 1; Davis 2/8/18 302, at 9; Devine 7/6/18 302, at 2-3. 855 Patten 5/22/18 302, at 5; Gates 1/29/18 302, at 18-19; 10/28/97 Kilimnik Visa Record , U.S. Department of State. 856 Gates 1/29/18 302, at 18-19; Patten 5/22/18 302, at 8; Gates 1/3 1/18 302, at 4-5; Gates 1/30/18 302, at 2; Gates 2/2/18 302, at 11. 857 Gates 1/29/18 302, at 18; Patten 5/22/18 302, at 8. 858 Boyarkin Visa Record, U.S. Department of State. 132 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atlerney Werlt Predttet // Mtty Centttin Mttterittl Preteeted Under Fed.

Manafort met Trump in 1982 when Trump hired the Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lobbying firm. 875 Over the years, Manafort saw Trump at political and social events in New York City and at Stone's wedding, and Trump requested VIP status at the 1988 and 1996 Republican conventions worked by Manafort. 876 868 Hawker 1/9/18 302, at 13; 3/18/14 Email, Hawker & Tulukbaev. 869 van der Zwaan pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to making false statements to the Special Counsel's Office.

Gates reported that Manafort intended, if Trump won the Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and monetize his relationship with the Administration. 878 ii.

On March 30, 2016, Gates emailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort' s appointment to Kilimnik for translation and dissemination. 881 Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages had been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown ""our friends"" the media coverage of his new role. 882 Kilimnik replied, ""Absolutely.

Pro-Russian Ukrainian militia forces, with backing from the Russian military , have occupied the region since 2014.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 1 Third , according to Gates and what Kilimnik told Patten, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed two sets of financial disputes related to Mana fort's previous work in the region. Those consisted of the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the funds that the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafort for his political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment. 933 After the meeting, Gates and Manafort both. stated that they left separately from Kilimnik because they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his connections to Kilimnik. 934 c. Post-Resignation Activities Manafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two weeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation, Manafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election. Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump, 935 and some of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016, Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the Campaign make the case against Clinton ""as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment "" and that ""Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible way - by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members .""936 Later, in a November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled ""Securing the Victory,"" Manafort stated that he was ""really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,"" and that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by ""mov[ing] immediately to discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.""937 Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the wake of Trump's victory, he was not interested in an Administration job. Manafort instead preferred to stay on the ""outside,"" and monetize his campaign position to generate business given his familiarity and relationship with Trump and the incoming Administration. 938 Manafort appeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and China and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entaii. 939 Manafort' s activities in early 20 17 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.

Oganov , who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States, was a senior executive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to Deripaska. 940 Manafort initially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledged it, he claimed that the meeting had been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles lawsuit. 941 Other evidence, however, provides reason to doubt Manafort's statement that the sole topic of the meeting was the Pericles lawsuit. In particular , text messages to Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik suggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin-not Manafort's counsel-had arranged the meeting between Manafort and Oganov. 942 Kilimnik's message states that the meeting was supposed to be ""not about money or Pericles"" but instead ""about recreating [the] old friendship""-ostensibly between Manafort and Deripaska- ""and talking about global politics. "" 943 Manafort also replied by text that he ""n eed[s] this finished before Jan. 20,"" 944 which appears to be a reference to resolving Pericles before the inauguration.

P. 6(e) 959 Those contacts included matters pertaining to the criminal charges brought by the Office , and the Ukraine peace plan. In early 2018 , Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft poll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik , and worked with Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions. 960 The primer sent to the pollsters specifically called for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas with Yanukovych as Prime Minister, 961 and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions on Yanukovych ' s role in resolving the conflict in Donbas. 962 (The poll was not solely about Donbas; it also sought participants' views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to the 2019 Ukraine presidential election.) The Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to the attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration. Kilimnik continued his efforts to promote the peace plan to the Executive Branch (e.g., U.S. Department of State) into the summer of 2018. 963 B. Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the election , individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the Trump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels-sometimes                   through Russian Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts reflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election- interference activities."

Outreach from the Russian Government At approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks received a telephone call on her personal cell phone from a person who sounded foreign but was calling from a number with a DC area code. 964 Although Hicks had a hard time understanding the person, she could make out the words ""Putin call."" 965 Hicks told the caller to send her an email. 966 The following morning, on November 9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian Embassy to the United States, emailed Hicks from his Gmail address with the subject line, ""Message from Putin."" 967 Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and Russian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to convey to the President-Elect. 968 In the message, Putin offered his congratulations to Trump for his electoral victory, stating he ""look[ ed] forward to working with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis."" 969 Hicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, ""Can you look into this? Don't want to get ° duped but don't want to blow off Putin!"" 97 Kushner stated in Congressional testimony that he believed that it would be possible to verify the authenticity of the forwarded email through the Russian Ambassador, whom Kushner had previously met in April 2016. 971 Unable to recall the Russian Ambassador's name, Kushner emailed Dimitri Simes of CNI, whom he had consulted previously about Russia, see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, supra, and asked, ""What is the name of Russian ambassador?

Kirill Dmitriev's Transition-Era Outreach to the Incoming Administration Aven's description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill Dmitriev , a Russian national who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected to Putin. Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in the months after the election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials, and Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a Trump Campaign supporter and an assoc iate of Steve Bannon. 989 In addition, the UAE national security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick Gerson, in late November 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson worked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied he cleared through Putin. Gerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration , and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. a.

Prince's phone contained no text messages prior to March 2017, though provider records indicate that he and Bannon exchanged dozens of messages. 1094 Prince denied deleting any messages but claimed he did not know why there were no messages on his device before March 2017. 1095 Bannon's devices similarly contained no messages in the relevant time period, and Bannon also stated he did not know why messages did not appear on his device. 1096 Bannon told the Office that, during both the months before and after the Seychelles meeting , he regularly used his personal Blackberry and personal email for work-related communications (including those with Prince), and he took no steps to preserve these work communications. 1097 d.

He noted in a text message to Gerson that if Russia was ""approached with respect and willingness to understand our position, we can have Major Breakthroughs quickly."" 1105 Gerson and Dmitriev exchanged ideas in December 2016 about what such a reconciliation plan would include. 1106 Gerson told the Office that the Transition Team had not asked him to engage in these discussions with Dmitriev, and that he did so on his own initiative and as a private citizen. 1107 On January 9, 2017, the same day he asked Nader whether meeting Prince would be worthwhile , Dmitriev sent his biography to Gerson and asked him if he could ""share it with Jared (or somebody else very senior in the team) - so that they know that we are focused from our side on improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that."" 1108 Dmitriev also asked Gerson if he knew Prince, and if Prince was somebody important or worth spending time 1099 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 1. 1100 Gerson 6/5/ 18 302, at 1-2; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 21. 1101 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3-4 ; see, e.g., 12/2/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson; 12/14/ 16 Text Mes sages, Dmitriev & Gerson; 1/3/17 Text Message , Gerson to Dmitriev; 12/2/16 Email, Tolokonnikov to Gerson. 1102 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3; 12/14/16 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. 1103 12/14/16 Text Message , Gerson to Dmitriev. 1104 12/14/16 Text Message , Gerson to Dmitriev . 1105 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson; Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 1. 1106 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson. 1107 Gerson 6/15/18 302, at I. 1108 1/9/17 Text Messages, Dmitriev to Gerson; 1/9/ 17 Text Message, Dm itriev to Nad er. 157 NA U.S. Department of Justice Att:erney ',l.ZerkPredttet II Mtty Centttin Mttterittl Preteeted Under Fed.

McFarland) in New York, Flynn asked Foresman for his thoughts on Kislyak. Foresman had not met Kislyak but told Flynn that , while Kislyak was an important person, Kislyak did not have a direct line to Putin. 1132 Foresman subsequently traveled to Moscow, inquired of a source he believed to be close to Putin, and heard back from that source that Ushakov would be the official channel for the incoming U.S. national security advisor. 1133 Foresman acknowledged that Flynn had not asked him to undertake that inquiry in Russia but told the Office that he nonetheless felt obligated to report the information back to Flynn, and that he worked to get a face-to-face meeting with Flynn in January 2017 so that he could do so. 1134 Email correspondence suggests that the meeting ultimately went forward, 1135 but Flynn has no recollection of it or of the earlier December meeting. 1136 (The investigation did not identify evidence of Flynn or Kushner meeting with Ushakov after being given his name. 1137) In the meantime , although he had already formed the impression that Kislyak was not necessarily the right point of contact , 1138 Kushner went forward with the meeting that Kislyak had requested on November 16. It took place at Trump Tower on November 30, 2016. 1139 At Kushner' s invitation , Flynn also attended; Bannon was invited but did not attend .1140 During the meeting, which lasted approximately 30 minutes , Kushner expressed a desire on the part of the incoming Administration to start afresh with U.S.-Russian relations. 1141 Kushner also asked Kislyak to identify the best person (whether Kislyak or someone else) with whom to direct future discussions-someone         who had contact with Putin and the ability to speak for him. 1142 The three men also discussed U.S. policy toward Syria , and Kislyak floated the idea of having Russian generals brief the Transition Team on the topic using a secure communications line. 1143 After Flynn explained that there was no secure line in the Transition Team offices, 1132 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17. 1133 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17-18. 1134 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 18. 1135 RMF-SCO-00000015 (1/5/17 Email, Foresman to Atencio & Flaherty); RMF-SCO-00000015 (1/5/17 Email, Flaherty to Foresman & Atencio). 1136 9/26/18 Attorney Proffer from Covington & Burling LLP (reflected in email on file with the Office). 1137 Vargas 4/4/18 302, at 5. 1138 Kushner 11/1/17 302, at 4. 1139 AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_0000016-019 (11/29/16 Email, Vargas to Kuznetsov). 114 °Flynn 1/11/18 302, at 2; NOS00004240 (Calendar Invite, Vargas to Kushner & Flynn). 1141 Kushner Strut. at 6. 1142 Kushner Strut. at 6; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. 1143 Kushner Stmt. at 7; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18; Flynn 1/11/18 302, at 2. 160 NA U.S. Department of Justice A1:l:tm·1ey '.VsrkProdttet// Mey CmttttiflMMerielProteetedUnder Fed.

Jared Kushner's Meeting with Sergey Gorkov On December 6, 2016, the Russian Embassy reached out to Kushner's assistant to set up a second meeting between Kislyak and Kushner. 1146 Kushner declined several proposed meeting dates, but Kushner's assistant indicated that Kislyak was very insistent about securing a second meeting. 1147 Kushner told the Office that he did not want to take another meeting because he had already decided Kislyak was not the right channel for him to communicate with Russia, so he arranged to have one of his assistants, Avi Berkowitz, meet with Kislyak in his stead. 1148 Although embassy official Sergey Kuznetsov wrote to Berkowitz that Kislyak thought it ""importa nt"" to ""continue the conversation with Mr. Kushner in person,"" 1149 Kislyak nonetheless agreed to meet ·instead with Berkowitz once it became apparent that Kushner was unlikely to take a meeting. Berkowitz met with Kislyak on December 12, 2016, at Trump Tower. 1150 The meeting lasted only a few minutes, during which Kislyak indicated that he wanted Kushner to meet someone who had a direct line to Putin: Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian-government- owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB). Kushner agreed to meet with Gorkov. 1151 The one-on-one meeting took place the next day, December 13, 2016, at the Colony Capital building in Manhattan , where Kushner had previously scheduled meetings. 1152 VEB was (and is) the subject of Department of Treasury econom ic sanctions imposed in response to Russia ' s annexation of Crimea. 1153 Kushner did not, however , recall any discussion during his meeting with Gorkov about the sanctions against VEB or sanctions more generally. 1154 Kushner stated in an interview that he did not engage in any preparation for 1144 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. 1145 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. 1146 Kushner Strut. at 7; NOSC00000123 (12/6/16 Email, Vargas to Kushner (12 : 11:40 p.m.)). 1147 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130 (12/12/16 Email, Kushner to Vargas (10:41 p.m.)). 1148 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; Kushner Stmt. at 7; DJTFP_SCO_01442290 (12/6/ 16 Email , Berkowitz to 1149 DJTFP - SCO- 01442290 (12/7/16 Email                      to Berkowitz (12:31 :39 p.m.)). 1150 Berkowitz 1/12/18 302, at 7; AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ _O0000l-04 (12/12/ 16 Text Messages, Berkowitz & 202-701-8532). 1151 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130-135 (12/12/16 Email, Kushner to Berkowitz). 1152 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130-135 (12/12/16 Email , Kushner to Berkowitz). 1153 Announcement of Treasury Sanctions on Entities Within the Financial Services and Energy Sectors of Russia, Against Arms or Related Materiel Entities, and those Undermining Ukraine's Sovereignty, United States Department of the Treasury (Jul. 16, 2014). 1154 Kushner 4/11 /18 302, at 20. 161 NA U.S. Department of Justice At:tefl'le:,\1/efk Predttet // Mo:,·CeHta:il'IMa:teria:lPreteetecl Ul'laer Fee.

Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic , with Gorkov expressing disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for improved relatio ns with the incoming Administration. 1157 According to Kushner, although Gorkov told Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the two did not discuss Kushner's companies or private business dealings of any kind. 1158 (At the time of the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at 666 Fifth Avenue, and there had been public reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the property and possible conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his company's borrowing from foreign lenders. 1159) In contrast, in a 2017 public statement, VEB suggested Gorkov met with Kushner in Kushner' s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather than as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB characterized Gorkov's meeting with Kushner as part of a series of ""roads how meetings"" with ""representatives of major US banks and business circles,"" which included ""negotiatio ns "" and discussion of the ""most promising business lines and sectors."" 1160 Foresman, the investment bank executive mentioned in Volume l, Sections IV.A.

Petr Aven's Outreach Efforts to the Transition Team In December 2016, weeks after the one-on -one meeting with Putin described in Volume I, Section IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate ""all-hands "" oligarch meeting between Putin and Russia's most prominent businessmen. 1167 As in Aven's one-on-one meeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 was the prospect of forthcoming U.S. economic sanctions. 1168 After the December 2016 all-hands meeting , A ven tried to establish a conn ection to the Trump team .

There is an interest and an understanding for the need to establish such a channel. But the individual emphasized that at this moment, with so much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking (and who ordered what) , Project A was too explosive to discuss.

""Project A"" was a term that Bmt created for Aven's effort to help establish a communications channel between Russia and the Trump team, which he used in light of the sensitivities surrounding what A ven was requesting, especially in light of the recent attention to Russia ' s influence in the U.S. presidential election. 1182 According to Burt , his repo rt that there was "" interest "" in a communications channel reflected Simes's views, not necessarily those of the Transition Team, and in any event , Burt acknowledged that he added some ""hype"" to that sentence to make it sound like there was more interest from the Transition Team than may have actually existed. 1183 1184 Aven replied to Burt ' s email on the same day, saying ""Than k you.

Flynn Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team ' s primary conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive matters during the transition period: a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian government ' s reaction to the United States ' s imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in the 2016 election. 1207 Despite Kushner ' s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside the Russian government, the Transition Team turn ed to Flynn's relationship with Kislyak on both issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland , his incoming deputy , to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time. Although transition officials at Mar- a-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29, 2016 , and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request. a.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel's Office ""to prosecute federal crimes arising from [its] investigation"" of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to exercise this prosecutorial authority , the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney's) Manual. In particular, the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction , and there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. Id. As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of Russian nationals for their roles in er etratin the active-measures social media cam ai n and similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations . A. Russian ""Active Measures"" Social Media Campaign On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities-including the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)- with violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes. 1276 The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and •bank fraud (Count Two) , and five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research Agency Indictment. Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds .

As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains ongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Rus sian nationals (Count Two). The Office did , however , charge one U.S . national for his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those systems ' security features.

Charging Decision As to Harm to Ongoing Matter Harm to Ongoing Matter -Harm        to Ongoing Matter 1278 The Office also considered , but ruled out, charges on the theory that the post-hacking sharing and dissemination of emails could constitute trafficking in or receipt of stolen property under the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2315. The statutes comprising the NSPA cover ""goods, wares , or merchandise,"" and lower coutts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to tangible items since the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985). See United States v. Yijia Zhang , 995 F. Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases). One of those post-Dowling decisions-United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)-specifically held that the NSPA does not reach ""a computer program in source code form,"" even though that code was stored in tangible items (i.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook). Id. at 1302-03. Congress, in turn, cited the Brown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) that ""would ensure that the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft of physical items [is] protected."" S. Rep. 104-357, at 7 (1996). That sequenc e of events would make it difficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, const itute ""goods, wares, or merchandise"" within the meaning of the NSPA. 176 NA U.S. Department of Justice Attemey 'Nerk Pr0d1:1et// Ma-y C0t1tait1Material Preteetea Ut1der Fed.

Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian -affiliated individuals- the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates         an additional body of law: campaign - finance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government , a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russia - affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges , several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice."
"33","Potential Coordination  Conspiracy and Collusion","1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion As an initial matter , this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of ""collusion,"" but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ""collud[ e]"" appears in the Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U .S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute , 18 U .S.C. § 371. See Black 's Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is ""[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law""); 1 Alexander Burrill , A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) (""An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.""); 1 Bouvier 's Law Dictionary 352 180 NA U.S . Department of Justice A:t:1:ertteyWerk Predttet // Mtt;s CetttttiH Mttterittl Preteeted Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) (1897) (""An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.""). For that reason, this Office ' s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term ""collusion."" The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g. , 18 U .S.C. §§ 1349, 195l(a)) , or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S .C. § 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra , amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law- including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws , both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371 's offenses clause. The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under Section 371 's defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or dishon est means. See Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S . 182, 188 (1924); see also United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 34 7 F. Supp. 3d 38, 46 (D.D .C.2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials- or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals-to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a government agency during the campaign or transition period. And , as discussed in Volume I, Section V.A , supra , the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the Office charged , namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra . Accordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-relat ed contact s described in Section IV above."
"34","Potential Coordination  Foreign Agent Statutes  FARA and 18 U.S.C","2. Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S .C. § 951) The Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under federal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government. a. Governing Law Under 18 U.S.C . § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without providing notice to the Attorney General. Although the defendant must act on behalf of a foreign government (as oppos ed to other kinds of foreign entities) , the acts need not involve espionage ; rather, acts of any typ e suffice for liability. See United States v. Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709 , 715 (7th Cir. 2009) ; United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566 , 581 (7th Cir. 2005) . An ""agent of a foreign government"" is an "" individual"" who ""agrees to operate "" in the United States ""subject to the direction or control of a foreign government or official.

P. 6(e) The crime defined by Section 951 is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States as an unregistered foreign-government agent. 18 U.S.C. § 95l(a). The statute does not require willfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense. United States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94 ; Dumeisi , 424 F.3d at 581. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent of a foreign principal by engaging in certain (largely political) activities in the United States without registering with the Attorney General. 22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621. The triggering agency relationship must be with a foreign principal or ""a person any of whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a foreign principal. "" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(l). That includes a foreign government or political party and various foreign individuals and entities. 22 U.S.C. § 611(6). A covered relationship exists if a person ""acts as an agent , representative , employee, or servant"" or ""in any other capacity at the order, request, or under the [foreign principal's] direction or control. "" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(l) . It is sufficient if the person ""agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds himself out to be , whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship , an agent of a foreign principal."" 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(2). The triggering activity is that the agent ""directly or through any other person "" in the United States (1) engages in ""political activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal ,"" which include s attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as ""public relations counsel, publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such foreign principal ""; (3) "" solicits, collects, disburses , or dispenses contributions , loans, money , or other things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal"" ; or (4) ""re presents the interests of such foreign principal"" before any federal agency or official. 22 U .S.C. § 611 (c)(1 ). It is a crime to engage in a "" [w ]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation thereunder. "" 22 U.S .C. § 618(a)(l). It is also a crime willfully to make false statements or omissions of material facts in FARA registration statements or supplements.                         22 U.S.C. § 618(a)(2). Most violations have a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. 22 U.S.C. § 618. b. Application The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort's and Richard Oates's pre -campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA. Manafort and Gates were charg ed for that conduct and admitted to it when they pleaded guilty to superseding criminal informations in the District of Columbia prosecution .1280 The evidence und erlying those charges is not addressed in this report because it was discussed in public court documents and in a separate 1280 Gates Superseding Criminal Information ; Waiver of Indictment, United States v.

In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael Flynn. Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey) and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge . Statement of Offense, United States v. Michael T Flynn, No. l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 4 (""Flynn Statement of Offense""). 1281 The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos , and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian overnrnent-or at its direction control, or re uest-durin       the relevant time eriod. 1282 As a result, the Office did not charge                 any other Trump Campaign official with violating FARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian government or a Russian principal. Finally , the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors-George Papadopoulos-acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel. While the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search warrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951."
"35","Campaign Finance","3. Campaign Finance Several areas of the Office's investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign. As explained below , the Office considered whether two of those efforts in particular - the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump 1282 On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b ), 1805(a)(2)(A). The FISC 's probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the one governing the Office's decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible evidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the Russian Federation during the period at issue. Cf United States v. Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C.

The Office determined that the evidence was not sufficient to charge either incident as a criminal violation. a. Overview Of Governing Law ""[T]he United States has a compelling interest ... in limiting the participation of foreign citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence over the U.S. political process."" Bluman v. FEC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 281, 288 (D.D.C. 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., for three-judge court), ajf'd, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012). To that end, federal campaign- finance law broadly prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations, expenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, and prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations. As relevant here, foreign nationals may not make- and no one may ""solicit,' accept, or receive"" from them-""a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" or ""an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election."" 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(l)(A), (a)(2). 1283 The term ""contr ibution,"" which is used throughout the campaign-finance law, ""includes"" ""any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."" 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i). It excludes , among other things, ""the value of [volunteer] services."" 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)(i). Foreign nationals are also barred from making ""an expenditure, independent expenditure , or disbursement for an electioneering communication."" 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(l)(C). The term ""expenditure "" ""includes"" ""any purchase , payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit , or gift of money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."" 52 U.S.C. §,30101(9)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, news stories and non-partisan get-out-the-vote activities. 52 U.S.C . § 3010 I (9)(B)(i)-(ii). An "" independent expenditure"" is an expenditure ""expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate"" and made independently of the campaign. 52 U.S.C. § 30101(17). An ""electioneering communication"" is a broadcast communication that ""refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office"" and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate. 52 u.s.c.§ 30104(f)(3). The statute defines ""foreign national "" by reference to FARA and the Immigration and Nationality Act, with minor modification. 52 U.S.C. § 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C. § 61 l(b)(l)-(3) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(20), (22)). That definition yields five, sometimes- overlapping categories of foreign nationals, which include all of the individuals and entities relevant for present purposes-namely, foreign governments and political parties, individuals 1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) , and prohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor union s, 52 U.S.C. § 3011 S(a); see Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 320 (2010).

A ""knowing[] and willful[]"" violation involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii). b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office concluded that, in light of the government's substantial burden of proof on issues of intent (""knowing"" and ""willful"") , and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that ""the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction. "" Justice Manual§ 9-27.220. In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an ""offer"" from Russia's ""Crown prosecutor"" to ""the Trump campaign"" of ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr. ' s] father."" The email described this as ""very high level and sensitive information"" that is ""part of Russia and its government's support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin."" Trump Jr. responded: ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer."" Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was attended by Trump Jr ., Manafort , and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects. This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals , 52 U .S.C. § 3012 l(a)(l )(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide ""official documents and information"" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influenc ing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources. The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 ; the solicitation of an illegal foreign - source contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of ""an express or implied promise to make a 185 NA U.S. Department of Justice Attomey Work Produet // Mtty CoHtttiHMttterittl Proteetea Under Fea. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) [foreign-source] contribution, "" both in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 3012l(a)(l)(A), (a)(2). There are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a ""thing of value"" within the meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted ""willfully,"" i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(i). i. Thing-of Value Element A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign ""documents and information"" of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits ""a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value."" 52 U.S.C. § 3012l(a)(l)(A), (a)(2) (emphasis added). And the term ""contribution"" is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws to ""include[]"" ""any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value."" 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The phrases ""thing of value"" and ""anything of value "" are broad and inclusive enough to encompass at least some forms of valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these phrases serve as ""term[ s] of art"" that are construed ""broad[ly]."" United States v. Nilsen , 967 F .2d 539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (""thing of value"" includes ""both tangibles and intangibles ""); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 20l(b)(l), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes) ; id. § 641 (theft of government property). For example, the term ""thing of value"" encompasses law enforcement reports that would reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306 , 310 (4th Cir . 1991); confidential information about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F .3d 1014, I 020 (4th Cir. 1994); secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir . 1985); and information about a witness's whereabouts, United States v. Sheker , 618 F.2d 607 , 609 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam). And in the public corruption context , "" ' thing of value' is defined broadly to include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received."" United States v. Renzi, 769 F.3d 731,744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations recognize the value to a campaign of at least some forms of information, stating that the term ""anything of value "" includes ""the provision of any goods or services without charge,"" such as ""membership lists"" and ""mailing lists. "" 11 C.F.R. § 100.52(d)(l) . The FEC has concluded that the phrase includes a state-by-state list of activists. See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v.

These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision offunds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value. At the same time , no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign -finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban , see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those questions could be especially difficult where the information consisted simply of the recounting of historically accurate facts. It is uncertain how courts would resolve those issues. ii. Willfulness Even assuming that the promised ""documents and information that would incriminate Hillary"" constitute a ""thing of value"" under campaign-finance law, the government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted ""knowingly and willfully, "" the government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. 2017) (""Election Offenses""); see Bluman , 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation requires ""proof of the defendant's knowledge of the law""); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (""knowledge of general unlawfulness ""). ""This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring , at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the offender is more likely to have an intent defense."" Election Offenses 123.               · On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context. The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or effo11sat concealment at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent disclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a showing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a year later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting , and may reflect an intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality. Additionally, in light of the unresolv ed legal questions about whether giving ""documents and information"" of the sort offered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he 187 NA U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Prod1:1et// Ma,· Cmnain Material Proteeted Under Fed. R. Criffi. P. 6(e) did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues. iii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l). The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution-would         likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting. Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign , it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485 , 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone's description of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information's value-i.e., that it would ""incriminate Hillary "" and ""would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father ""-was non- specific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone's lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr. ' s response (""if it's what you say I love it"") (emphasis added). Accordingly , taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting . c.

"36","False Statem ents and Obstruction of the Investigation","4. False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation The Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with the investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected to the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses. a. Overview Of Governing Law False Statements. The principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to government investigators is 18 U.S.C. § 1001. As relevant here , under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a crime to knowingly and willfully ""make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation"" ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of th e executive ... branch of the Government."" An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch's jurisdiction. United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative branch actions-viz., administrative matters and ""investiga tion[s] or review[ s ]"" conducted by a congressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. § 1001(c)(l) and (2); see United States v. Pickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Whether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators , the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non -jurisdictional elements : the stat ement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent ; the defendant knew both that it was false and that it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false stateme nt was material. See, e.g., United States v. Smith , 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circu it Pattern Instruction 8.73 & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in light of the Department of Justice's position that the phrase ""knowingly and willfully "" in th e statute require s the defendant's knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful). In the D.C. Circuit , the government must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but ""litera lly true"" does not satisfy Section 1001 (a)(2). See United States v. Milton, 8 F .3d 39 , 45 191 NA U.S. Department of Justice A·tlerney Werk Predttet /,' Mfty Cm~tftil'lMftteriftl Preteeted Ul'lder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6Ee) (D.C. Cir. 1993); United States v. Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 832-33 & n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1993). For that false statement to qualify as ""materia l,"" it must have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing , a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it is addressed. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995) ; United States v. Moore, 612 F .3d 698 , 70 1 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Perjury. Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath before a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration. See 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The government must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under Section 1623(a): the defendant testified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant's testimony was false in one or more respects; the false testimony concerned matters that were material to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given. United States v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D .C. Cir. 1983). The general perjury statute , 18 U.S.C. § 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has sim ilar elements, except that it requires that the witness have acted willfully and that the government satisfy ""strict common-law requirements for establishing falsity."" See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979) (explaining ""the two-witness rule"" and the corroboration that it demands). Obstruction of Just ice. Three basic elements are common to the obstruction stat utes pertinent to this Office's charging decisions: an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) int ent. A detailed discussion of those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in Volume II of the report. b. Application to Certain Individuals i. George Papadopoulos Investigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and hi s suggestion to a foreign government representative that Russia had indicat ed that it could assist the Campaign thr ough the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton. On January 27 , 2017 , Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the inve stigation into potential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent , and nature of his communications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya , and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians had ""dirt"" on Clinton in the form of ""thousand s of emails."" But Papadopoulos stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campa ign and that it was a ""very strange coincidence "" to be to ld of the ""dirt"" before he started working for the Campaign . This accou nt was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsu d for the first time on approximately March 14, 2016 , after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos on ly after learn ing of his ro le on the Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians possessing ""dirt"" on candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and 192 NA U.S . Department of Justice Attorney \¥erk Prodttet // Mey Cot1teit1Materiel Proteeted Under Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) been publicly announced by candidate Trump.

Papadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to mmumze the extent and importance of his communications with Mifsud. For example, Papadopoulos stated that "" [Mifsud]'s a nothing ,"" that he thought Mifsud was ""just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something,"" and that he believed Mifsud was ""BS'ing to be completely honest with you ."" In fact, however , Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high -level Russian government officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling Papadopoulos about the ""dirt ."" Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to arrange a ""history making "" meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. In addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev , the Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or "" [a]nyone with a Russian accent"" during the campaign. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r       27-29. Papadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campa ign, and falsely told the FBI that he had ""no"" relationship at all with her . He stated that the extent of their communications was her sending emails-""Just,         'Hi , how are you?' That's it."" In truth , however , Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with her over Skype on numerous occasions about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r     30-31. Papadopoulos 's false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediatel y, those statements hindered investigators' ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Gov't Sent. Mem . at 6, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1 :17-cr-182 (D .D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview , Mifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and Timofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meetin g at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions-April           12 and April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meetin g and that, as reflected in the language of that email chain (""Baby, thank you!""), Mifsud may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time. The false information and omissions in Papadopoulos ' s January 20 17 interview undermined investi gators ' ability to challenge Mifsud when he made these inaccurate statements. 193 NA U.S. Department of Justice Atlort1ey Work PFodttet// Miey CoHtttiHMaterial Prnteeted Ut1det1Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) Given the seriousness of the lies and omissions and their effect on the FBI's investigation, the Office charged Papadopoulos with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Information, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. l:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Oct. 3, 2017), Doc. 8. On October 7, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to that charge pursuant to a plea agreement. On September 7, 2018 , he was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, a $9,500 fine, and 200 hours of community service. ii. -"
